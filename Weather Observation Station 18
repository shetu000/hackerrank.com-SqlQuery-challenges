*Weather Observation Station 18*


##Problem:
Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.
a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points and and round it to a scale of decimal places.
Input Format
The STATION table is described as follows:

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.



#solution :
the result should be abs(c-a) + abs(d-b



#result query:
select ROUND(ABS(MAX(LAT_N) - MIN(LAT_N)) + ABS(MAX(LONG_W) - MIN(LONG_W)), 4) FROM STATION;
